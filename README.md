# mysql-tester
Planned to provide a "mysql playground" to allow queries to be quickly generated and tested

Currently supports 2 modes,
### Select
Selects everything from the database and columns selected on the right

### Describe
Describes the table layout of the selected table.

All responses are then generated as a table on the page.
WIP Not sanitized, also allows raw queries to be executed!
